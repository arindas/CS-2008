## Group Assignment: Minimum Spanning Tree
<img src="Assignment/mst.svg" alt="Fig.1 Minimum Spanning Tree" width=400px/>
We have some network nodes on a 2D cartesian plane.
#### Objective
- Connect all the *network nodes* to a network with the *minimum possible packet exchange cost*.
* For this purpose we construct a **minimum spanning tree ** with the vertices being the *network nodes* and the edges being the *network lines*.
